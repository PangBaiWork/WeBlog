## Introduction 
What is a blog? It is another world for us,also a warm nest where you can say what you want to say,
share new and beautiful things you have learned.
It is a pure and undisturbed land , where no one teaches you how to do things, and you can express everything wholeheartedly.
It can record your life, your growth. If you want, even your entire life.  

Static blog engines allow users to run their blogs at the lowest cost. 
Have you ever thought about writing and publishing your own blog on your phone?  
Perhaps it's a formal meeting, perhaps it's being in a noisy crowd, or perhaps it's a long and boring journey,
using the time wasted by meaningless things to summarize and share in your blog.
You may have already known some immature solutions, but now there are better ones.
